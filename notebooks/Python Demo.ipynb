    "MFF is a Python package developed for generating reconciled forecasts with exogenous variables. This Jupyter notebook will provide a walkthrough of the main functionality of this package and key classes for users to customize their experience.\n",

    "The program is comprised of one high-level function MFF. MFF uses three steps to generate forecasts:\n",
    "1. Parsing constraints\n",
    "2. Estimating forecasts and residual covariance function\n",
    "3. Reconciliation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover how to use the MFF function and the individual functionalities for further customization"

This is done separately from the main .fit() call, as generating out-of-sample residuals for covariance matrices could be potentially computationally expensive.
